REQUIREMENTS
REQ-01There shall be serial communication between the client and the server.

REQ-02: Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using AES-256 and authenticated using HMAC-SHA256

REQ-03: The server must allow only one active session at a time, which expires after 1 minute of inactivity.

REQ-04: The server must use an RGB LED to visually indicate its status:- Red for server errors.- Blue for invalid client requests.

REQ-05: The client must have a graphical user interface (GUI)  to:
   -Establish and terminate sessions.
   - Retrieve ESP32 core temperature.
   - Toggle a relay connected to pin 32.
   - Log and display the status, state, and results of requests

REQ-06: Prevent unauthorized access and ensure no communication is processed without a valid session.

REQ-07: The system should support potential upgrades, such as additional commands or extended session timeouts.

REQ-08: The system shall use RSA-2048 to securely share AES-256 keys and initialization vectors between the client and server.

REQ-09: If a session expires due to inactivity, the client should be able to automatically re-establish the session 
    -with a single retry attempt

REQ-09: The secure communication system should adhere to standard security protocols 
    -(e.g., HMAC-SHA256, AES-256, RSA-2048) to meet data protection and confidentiality expectations.

REQ-10: The system design must allow for the addition of new features 
    -(e.g., additional client commands or sensors) without significant architectural changes

REQ-11: he client application should run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, 
    -macOS, and Linux, to cater to diverse user environments.
